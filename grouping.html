        <h1>My Mission</h1>
        <p>My mission as a <span>teacher</span> is to raise up students who will become future leaders by instilling Christ-centered morals so that they can create for us a better future. For me, this means that I may need to step aside at times and adjust my curriculum to what students enjoy learning.The ultimate goal of teaching is to promote learning. For the most part, learning takes place in many different circumstances and contexts. Although everyone is capable of learning, a student's desire to learn is a vital to mastering new concepts, principles and skills.The ultimate goal of teaching is to promote learning.
