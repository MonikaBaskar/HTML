    <h1>French fries receipes</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>potatoes</li>
       <li>oil</li>
       <li>cold water</li>
       <li>rosemary</li>
       <li>salt</li>
       <li>red chilli powder</li>
    </ul>
<h4>Prepping Potatoes
<ol>
    <li>Firstly take the potatoes and rinse well in water.</li> 
    <li>Then peel them.</li> 
    <li>Then slice the potato in slices having 1 cm thickness.</li> 
    <li>Before slicing, you can remove the top and bottom part of the potato to get a square or rectangle shaped potato.</li>
    <li>Then begin to cut them in sticks having 1 cm width. Rinse these potato sticks for a couple of times in water to get rid of the extra starch.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Soaking Potatoes</h4>
<ol>
    <li>In a bowl take 3.5 cups cold water and place the potatoes in it.</li> 
    <li>Keep this bowl outside or in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 45 minutes.</li> 
    <li>In a hot and humid climate keep the bowl in the fridge.</li>
    <li>After 30 minutes or 45 minutes, drain the potatoes in a colander.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Rinsing and Drying Potato Sticks</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Rinse the potatoes in clean fresh water using a colander or mesh strainer.</li> 
    <li>Drain all the water.</li>
    <li>Then place them on clean kitchen cotton napkin.</li>
    <li>Fold the napkin above and press, pat and dry the potatoes.</li>
    <li>The potatoes have to be completely dried before you begin to fry them.</li> 
</ol>
<h4>First Frying</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Heat oil in a wok or pan over medium-low or medium heat. For a heavy pan, keep medium heat and for a less heavy pan, use a medium-low heat. The oil should have a temperature of 135 degrees Celsius (275 degrees Fahrenheit).
    <li>Now, working in batches, add the potatoes to the oil. Do not overcrowd the wok (kadai) or pan with the potatoes. The oil will sizzle and bubble less when you fry the potatoes at this temperature.
    <li>Stir at intervals while frying them for uniform cooking.
    <li>Fry/blanch in oil for about 3 minutes or until the potatoes are cooked, but not brown from outside. They should just get a crust from outside without any major color change. Light browning of the edges is fine. Remove with a slotted spoon.
    <li>Place the half fried potatoes on paper kitchen towels. Stack 3 to 4 paper towels. Press some paper towels from top also to absorb extra oil. Let the half fried potatoes cool down at room temperature. 
    <li>Note that after removing this batch, you can fry the second batch of potatoes. By the time you fry the second batch of the potatoes, the first batch will cool down. So even though you have to fry twice, youâ€™re using the same batch of oil all the way through. 
</ol>
<h4>Second Frying</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Now increase the heat to a medium-high or high.</li>
    <li>Again here for a heavy pan, use a high heat and for a less heavy pan, use medium-high heat.</li>
    <li>The oil should be hot on medium-high to high heat having a temperature of 180 to 185 degrees celsius (356 to 365 degrees Fahrenheit).</li>
    <li>Add the first batch of once-fried potatoes to the hot oil. The oil will sizzle and bubble quickly and as soon as you add the potatoes.</li>
    <li>Stir often while the potatoes fry to cook them evenly.</li>
    <li>Fry french fries for 3 minutes or until crisp and golden.</li> 
    <li>The edges should become golden. Remove with a slotted spoon.</li>
    <li>Place french fries on paper tissues again to remove the extra oil.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Making Air Fried French Fries</h4>
<ol>
    <li>After drying them thoroughly, mix and coat the potato sticks with 2 tablespoons oil.</li> 
    <li>Take a batch and line the sticks evenly in the air-fryer basket. You can also line the potatoes on a parchment paper in the basket.</li>
    <li>Before air-frying, preheat the air-fryer at 180 degrees Celsius (356 degrees Fahrenheit) for 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
    <li>Place the air-fryer basket with the potato sticks in the air-fryer. Air-fry for about a total time of 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
    <li>Half way through after about 5 to 6 minutes, shake the basket or turn over each fry with tongs or a spoon.</li>
    <li>Air fry again for 5 to 6 minutes until golden.</li>
    <li>Remove the air-fried fries in a bowl. Work in batches this way and make air-fryer french fries.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Serving Suggestions</h4>
<ol>
    <li>While still hot, take the french fries (whether deep fried or air-fried) in a bowl.</li> 
    <li>Sprinkle with some salt, paprika or red chili flakes, dried herbs or dry rosemary. </li>
    <li>You can add your choice of herbs and spices.</li>
    <li>Gently shake and toss the bowl so that the salt, herbs mix evenly with the fries.</li>
    <li>Serve these homemade french fries hot with any dip or sauce of your choice.</li>
    <li>Tomato ketchup and Cilantro Chutney are our favorite dips to go with french fries.</li>
    <li>We also like to serve with some Eggless Mayonnaise.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Make Ahead and Storage</h4>
<ol>
    <li>For freezing and storing french fries in large quantities, fry/blanch the potatoes in hot oil first for about 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
    <li>Wipe the extra oil with kitchen paper towels and when cooled, line the half-fried potatoes on a tray. Cover the tray with a kitchen napkin and freeze for an hour.</li>
    <li>Remove the frozen fries from the tray and transfer to a zip-lock bag or a container and store in your freezer.</li>
    <li>Now you can deep fry, bake or air-fry these frozen fries. When cooking the fries with any of these methods, you do not need to thaw the frozen finger chips.</li>
    <li>While deep frying, heat oil until medium or medium-high hot and deep fry the fries until golden and crisp. Sprinkle salt or ground spices, herbs and serve straight away.</li>
    <li>Remove and add in salt and herbs. Toss, mix and serve hot.</li>
